# KnowledgeGraph - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Architecture & Foundation
- [x] Set up React environment with Tailwind CSS.
- [x] Define global types for Roadmaps, Nodes, and Resources (`types.ts`).
- [x] Configure Google Gemini API service for structured content generation (`services/geminiService.ts`).
- [x] Implement basic App shell and state management.

## Phase 2: User Intake & AI Logic
- [x] Build the 3-step conversational Intake Form component.
- [x] Refine Gemini prompts for high-quality, structured curriculum output.
- [x] Implement "Architecting Roadmap" loading state with UX feedback.
- [x] Add input validation and error handling for edge cases in user prompts.

## Phase 3: Interactive Visualization (Knowledge Graph)
- [x] Integrate React Flow for graph rendering.
- [x] Create custom `RoadmapNode` component with dynamic styling based on status (locked, available, completed).
- [x] Implement hierarchical layout logic (coordinates generated by AI or calculated client-side).
- [x] Enable smooth zoom, pan, and interactive controls.

## Phase 4: Content & Progress Tracking
- [x] Build the `ResourcePanel` side-drawer for node details.
- [x] Implement resource ranking and display (video, article, documentation).
- [x] Create progress tracking logic:
    - [x] Local state updates for resource completion.
    - [x] "Mark Node Complete" logic.
    - [x] Prerequisite-based unlocking system.
- [x] Implement local storage persistence for user progress.

## Phase 5: Dashboard & Gamification
- [x] Design and build the User Dashboard.
- [x] Integrate Recharts for learning velocity visualization.
- [x] Implement streak tracking and stat cards (Hours Invested, Nodes Completed).
- [x] Add "Achievements" system for specific milestones (First Node, First Milestone).

## Phase 6: Polish & Deployment
- [x] Refine mobile responsiveness for the graph view.
- [x] Add transitions and animations.
- [x] Implement GitHub Actions deployment workflow.
- [x] Create comprehensive Deployment Guide.

## Technical Considerations
- **AI Latency:** Use meaningful loading messages during the 5-10s generation window.
- **Graph Scalability:** Ensure React Flow handles 20-40 nodes smoothly.
- **Data Persistence:** Initial MVP uses local state; production requires a backend (Supabase/PostgreSQL) as per PRD.

## Phase 2 Implementation: The Career Suite

### Week 1: The "Proof" Layer (Certificates & Resume)
- [ ] **Install Libraries:** `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for client-side PDF generation.
- [ ] **Certificate Component:** Create `src/components/CertificateView.tsx`.
    - Design the layout (Canvas).
    - Add "Download PDF" function.
- [ ] **Resume Service:** Update `geminiService.ts` with `generateResumePoints(completedNodes)`.
- [ ] **Dashboard Update:** Add "Career" tab to `App.tsx`.

### Week 2: The "Habit" Layer (Daily Briefs)
- [ ] **New Backend Logic:** Store `lastDailyBriefDate` in LocalStorage.
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering:** Create "Brief Generator" prompt (Focus: Short, Action-Oriented, Fun).
- [ ] **UI:** Add "Daily Mission" card to the top of the Dashboard.

### Week 3: The "Boss Fight" (Verification Chat)
- [ ] **New Component:** `src/components/BossFightModal.tsx`.
- [ ] **Chat Logic:** Simple 3-turn conversation loop.
- [ ] **Locking Mechanism:** Update `RoadmapGraph` to prevent clicking "Complete" on milestones until Boss Fight is won.
## Phase 2: The Wolf Expansion (Career Tools)

- [ ] **Feature: Daily Briefs**
    - Update `App.tsx` to call `generateDailyBrief` when a node is clicked.
    - Create `components/DailyBriefCard.tsx` (Timer + Markdown display).

- [ ] **Feature: Resume Generator**
    - Create `components/CareerPanel.tsx`.
    - Add "Export to CV" button in the Dashboard.

- [ ] **Feature: Certificates**
    - Install `jspdf`.
    - Create `services/certificateService.ts` to draw the canvas.
    - Add "Claim Certificate" button when progress === 100%.
